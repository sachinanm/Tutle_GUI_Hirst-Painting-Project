# Turtle Spot Painting 🎨

This is a recreation of [Damien Hirst's Spot Painting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damien_Hirst#Spot_painting) using Python with the help of the Turtle module. We will create a colorful piece of art inspired by Hirst's work, which sold for more than half a million pounds! Our version will consist of 10*10 random colored dots, all made possible with the well-known Turtle module present in the Python library.

## What are we up to? 🤔

We are going to create a colorful spot painting with Python! By using the Turtle module, we will draw 25 random colored dots to mimic Damien Hirst's iconic style. This will be a fun and creative way to explore basic art creation using code.

## Prerequisites 🖍️

To proceed with this project, make sure you meet the following requirements:

1. Familiarity with the Turtle module in Python (If you are new, don't worry, the internet can be your guide, and it's easy to pick up 😉).
2. Installation of the Colorgram package (We want our painting to be as colorful as Damien Hirst's 🌈).
3. Basic comprehension of the RGB color system 🧮.

## Let's Paint! 🎨

To create our spot painting, we'll follow these steps:
1. Extract colors from an image using the Colorgram package.
2. Use the Turtle module to draw 25 random colored dots on the canvas.
3. Enjoy the beautiful artwork that we've recreated with Python!

## Beware of the Whites! ⚪

While using our `color_list`, there might be some colors at the beginning that are close to white (similar to the background color in the image). These colors might be unnecessary for our spot painting. We can test the color tuples and remove any undesired colors to enhance the visual impact.

Feel free to explore the code and make adjustments to create your unique and colorful spot painting masterpiece! 🌟

Happy painting!

## Tasks to Enhance the Project 🚀

1. 🔳 **Customizing the Dot Grid:** Experiment with different grid sizes and dot colors. Change the number of dots in the grid, increase or decrease the distance between dots, and use a different color palette for the dots.

2. 🎨 **Randomizing Dot Sizes:** Modify the code to draw dots of varying sizes. Randomly select the size of each dot to create a more dynamic and visually interesting painting.

3. 🌈 **Gradient Effect:** Instead of using solid colors for the dots, try implementing a gradient effect where the colors transition smoothly from one to another within the grid.

4. 🖱️ **Interactive Painting:** Allow user interaction by letting them click on the screen to add dots at their desired positions. Provide options for users to select their preferred colors.

5. 🖼️ **Custom Images:** Experiment with different images and extract colors from them to create spot paintings based on various sources of inspiration.

6. 🎆 **Animated Painting:** Animate the dots, making them move and change colors over time to create an animated spot painting.

7. 💾 **Save and Share:** Add functionality to save the final spot painting as an image file, such as PNG or JPEG, so that you can share your creations with others.

8. 🖥️ **Make it Responsive:** Adjust the grid size and dot positions based on the size of the Turtle window, making the painting responsive to the window's dimensions.

9. 🌟 **Dynamic Colors:** Explore libraries like `matplotlib` to create dynamic and interactive color palettes for the dots.

10. 🔳 **Experiment with Shapes:** Instead of using dots, try using other shapes, such as squares, triangles, or custom shapes, to create a unique spot painting.

## Feel free to explore and experiment with different ideas to create your own version of the Turtle spot painting! Happy coding! 🎉
